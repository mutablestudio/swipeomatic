# swipeomatic
This project mimicks the functionality of iOS where navigation can occur by swiping from left to right to move back in the navigation stack (the navigationController->interactivePopGestureRecognizer delegate). The difference in this code vs existing libraries like `https://github.com/ikew0ng/SwipeBackLayout` is that I prefer to use Fragments for my app. So this project is an example of using multiple fragments inside a single Activity and allowing the user to swipe to navigate. It also maintains compatibility with hardware back button as well as toolbar / action bar home buttons.
